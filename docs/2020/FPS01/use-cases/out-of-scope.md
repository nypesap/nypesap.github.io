# Applications out of scope

With Fiori Apps' Usage Report you can list the apps started by users but are not part of the project scope. On the one hand, the list can help you keep the project documentation updated. On the other hand, it can signal an uncontrolled growth in a project's scope (scope creep). Scope creep is a risk in most projects as it often results in cost overrun.
