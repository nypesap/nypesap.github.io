**Our 2018 SAP S/4HANA project was slowed down by repetitive SAP Fiori content management tasks.**

To streamline the collaboration in SAP team, we developed [**Fiori Tracker**](https://fioritracker.org/), a tool that has become integral to our work ever since.

**Fiori Tracker is built to support blueprinting.** 

It imports the system's catalogs and app lists, offering a user-friendly view for all SAP project members. The view links apps to roles, SAP Fiori app usage logs and other records. It serves as a central reference for all SAP S/4HANA developments.

**We offer Fiori Tracker at no cost for customers who agree to have their name published on the Fiori Tracker customer list.**

Our internal work with Fiori Tracker sharpens the tools we later use for client projects.
