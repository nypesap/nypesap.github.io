**Our 2018 SAP S/4HANA project was slowed down by repetitive SAP Fiori content management tasks.**

To streamline the collaboration in SAP team, we developed **Fiori Tracker**, a tool that has become integral to our work ever since.

Fiori Tracker is made to blueprint: imports the list of catalogs and apps from the system, offering a user-friendly view for all SAP project members. Serves as a central reference for all SAP S/4HANA developments.

**We  offer Fiori Tracker at no cost for customers who agree to have their name published on the Fiori Tracker customer list.**
