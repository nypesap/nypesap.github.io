The work focused on analyzing and reverse-engineering existing SAP Cloud Process Integration (SAP CPI) flows to enable the migration of three country-wide organizations from SAP Business Suite into an existing SAP S/4HANA environment. The effort ensured that all critical integrations between SAP Business Suite and SAP Configure Price Quote (SAP CPQ) were compatible with the new S/4HANA architecture.

Key integration scenarios included:

- Inbound to SAP CPQ
    * Material master  
    * Cost
    * Price
    * Exchange rates

- Outbound from SAP CPQ:
    * Sales contract 
    * Sales order
