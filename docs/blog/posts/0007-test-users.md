# Streamlining SAP Fiori Testing with the Test User App from Fiori Tracker Suite

SAP S/4HANA project teams support SAP Fiori apps available on SAP Fiori Launchpad. An essential aspect of the support is testing. Since the apps are designed based on roles, the team requires test users with those roles.

When your custom SAP app is ready, your SAP Fiori developer can jump in and start unit testing. They can see exactly what the SAP Functional expert sees during their tests.

But test users often hit roadblocks: blocked access, expired passwords, and constant changes. These issues delay sign-offs and production releases.

Instead of dealing with e-mailed lists and constant updates, we use the Test User app from Fiori Tracker Suite. This app logs all our test users, centralizes management, and is accessible to everyone in the QA system.

Best of all, Fiori Tracker is free if you let us feature your company name as a user.
