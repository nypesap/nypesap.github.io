In the the evolving landscape of SAP Fiori, tracking application usage is essential for project organization and optimizing, yet standard SAP does not  offer built-in reporting tools for this purpose.

## Understanding the Challenge

Tracking SAP Fiori application usage is vital for optimizing user experience, yet SAP does not provide a built-in way to report this data. Users cannot see which Fiori apps are most frequently used. 

This missing feature has been a significant issue for many users. To tackle it, Nype designed Fiori App Usage Report specifically for this purpose. Fiori App Usage Report is designed to enable organizations to collect usage statistics of their SAP Fiori applications.

## Introducing Fiori Tracker with Fiori App Usage Report

[Fiori App Usage Report report](https://fioriappsusage.org) is part of [Fiori Tracker Suite](https://fioritracker.org)  a custom solution developed by the Nype team to fill the gap left by SAP’s standard.
