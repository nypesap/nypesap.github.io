## What is Fiori Role Testing?


Fiori Role Testing tracks whether SAP Fiori applications linked to specific roles have been tested. It ensures all these apps are checked before they go live. The tool uses proven [Fiori App Usage](https://fioriappsusage.org) to do this. Fiori Role Testing is straightforward and practical. It aims to spot the most common issues with SAP Fiori apps, such as inactive services or missing authorizations.
