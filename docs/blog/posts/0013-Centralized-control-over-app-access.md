# Centralized control over app access - Fiori Launchpad content manager role in SAP projects

Although there is no official Fiori Launchpad content manager role in the SAP methodology, I suggest SAP project should establish one. Depending on the number of apps in the project scope, this role can be handled by a single individual who can also manage other tasks. The estimated effort required for this role ranges from one man-day a week to full-time.

## Why Fiori Launchpad needs a dedicated content manager?

Here is a summary of the impacts of not having a long-term role (support mode) FLP content manager:

1. Increased risk of disruptions in end-user work
2. Lack of centralized control over app access, increasing security threats.
3. Higher maintenance costs: The functional analyst, developer, basis, and authorization expert need significant additional effort
4. Lack of records/documentation resulting in instability during personnel shifts (knowledge loss)
5. Delayed delivery of SAP Fiori custom and extended apps
