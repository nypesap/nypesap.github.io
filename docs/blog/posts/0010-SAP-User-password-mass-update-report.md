description: SAP user password mass update report
---

# SAP user password mass update report

Each implementation project with SAP Fiori's role-based principle brings the need to keep numerous test users. Those test users are going to be used by different project members simultaneously, thus the need to share the test users with their passwords.

<!-- more -->

 Before sharing the list, there is a need to set the users’ passwords. Manually updating more than 10 passwords seems like a tedious task. Especially that there are two steps needed:

1. Setting the password,
2. Making sure that there is no forced change at the first logon

Below is the report that automates this job.

The report sets the passwords the same as users, but feel free to adapt the program if you find it disturbing.

``` ABAP
REPORT zfioripassreset.

DATA: uname TYPE xubname, returny TYPE i, 
bapimsg LIKE bapiret2 OCCURS 0 WITH HEADER LINE, 
p_passw TYPE bapipwd.

END OF ty_itab.

INITIALIZATION.
